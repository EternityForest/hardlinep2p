Inside the files below are both male and female verisons of varying ages.

A friend and I were making a portrait gen tool. We didn't finish it (no dark skins, no wild hair colors, etc), but here are 200 random results from it. Feel free to use them in whatever you want! Go make some games!

Also I made a paypal.me for anyone who wants to tip for these assets I'm giving away, but don't feel obligated by any means. It's more important that cool indie games get made! We gotta stick together!

I included below a .png (lossless, 30 megs) and a decent .jpg(8 megs) that is a much smaller file.
